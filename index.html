    <ol>
        <li>CSS stand for Cascoding Style Sheet </li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li>
        <li><b><del>CSS is not neccassry</del> <span>CSS saves a lot of work.</span><b> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>
        <li><i><ins>External style are stored in CSS files</ins></i></li>
    </ol>

    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an eernal CSS file. </li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><span>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

       
    </ul>
<p> When comparing CSS class vs Id, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element, ID on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
<p>In CSS, selector are to target a specific element or range of element on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
<p>There is wide range of selector avilable. Two of find most commonly used are class and ID Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied</p>
